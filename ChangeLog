	* build system: Most important change: adding code that handles
	--disable-xxx options passed to the script:
	--disable-console
	--disable-oss
	--disable-alsa
	--disable-cwcp
	--disable-xcwcp
	The options allow disabling certain functionalities of unixcw, so
	that the package can be built on machines that don't provide some
	functions or properties.
	Example: unixcw 3.0.1 can't be compiled on hurd-i386 because of
	this error from configure script:
	"configure: error: Cannot find either sys/kd.h, sys/vtkd.h, or sys/kbio.h"
	At lease one of these headers is needed for console buzzer support.
	With new code in configure, compilation of code working with console
	buzzer can be disabled.
	Similarly, user can now disable compilation of OSS-related code on
	platforms that no longer provide OSS.
	Functionality can be disabled explicitly (with command line option),
	or implicitly - if any of tests performed by configure script fails.
	Changes described above required some modifications of libcw.c file.
	Also added --enable-dev.

	Build system now uses Makefile.am and Makefile.in files used/generated
	by Automake. Adding two calls to configure: AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE (build
	system now uses Automake to handle Makefile files), and
	AC_PROG_LIBTOOL (libtool is now used to create libraries).

	Build system now supports "make distcheck" target.

	Build system now depends on libtool.
