version 3.0.1 / 2012.01.08

Thanks to Kamal Mostafa for providing patches that are the reason
for 3.0.1 release.
Content of upstream package unixcw-3.0.1 is approximately the same as of
Debian source package unixcw_3.0-5.

  debian/:
  - added proper "Section" field in control file;
  - fixed library dependencies in control file;
  - fixed "Replaces:"/"Conflicts:" fields in control file;
  - fixed Debian bug #653411: changes in *.preinst files to remove
    dangling symlinks left by old packaging (suggested by Bob Proulx);

  general:
  - fixed library dependencies in "configure" script;
  - fixed library dependencies provided by libcw.pc file;

  libcw:
  - proper detection of capabilities of liboss-salsa-dev
    (kfreebsd's libasound implementation); libcw now can be built
    properly on Debian/kFreeBSD;
  - fixing awk scripts producing man pages: the awk scripts now
    work with mawk too;

  cwcp:
  - fixed list of libraries in Makefile;

version 3.0 / 2011.12.13

Thanks to Simon Baldwin for creating this software in the
first place, and to Kamal Mostafa for helping me with packaging
unixcw 3.0 for Debian.

  unixcw:
  - Changed major version of unixcw package to '3'. Changes listed
    below probably justify this.
  - New main developer: Kamil Ignacak <acerion@wp.pl>
  - New website: http://unixcw.sourceforge.net
  - Scripts building Debian packages now build 'libcw3' package
    instead of 'unixcw' package, and 'libcw3-dev' Debian package instead
    of 'unixcw-dev' Debian package.

  libcw:
  - Renamed 'cwlib' part of unixcw package to 'libcw'.
  - Renamed library's header file from cwlib.h to libcw.h.
  - Changed library's soname from 0 to 3 (/usr/lib/libcw.so.3.0.0
    / libcw.so.3).
  - Added support for ALSA. OSS is still the default backend.
  - As a consequence, libasound2 is a new dependency. There is no
    possibility (yet) to disable or reconfigure this at build time.
    It is possible to select sound backend in applications that use
    libcw.
  - Added implicit dependency on pthread library (which is a part
    of libc library, so it should be available on target system by
    default). Main routine generating sine wave operates as a separate
    thread.
  - Added actual slopes to dot and dash sounds produced by the
    library. This should result in less of (or even none) audible
    pops. Unfortunately current implementation makes dots and dashes
    a tiny bit longer than they would be without the slopes. The
    difference is not significant, but I plan to re-implement it
    in the future to make this feature 100% correct.
    The slopes are linear.
  - Rewritten management of sound volume so that the library doesn't
    use OSS mixer. This should resolve Debian bug #567394
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567394).
    Code that controls volume level is common for OSS and ALSA.
  - Since libcw doesn't touch the mixer device anymore, then Debian
    bug #567392 should be resolved as well
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567392).
  - Added code that attempts to discover proper audio buffer size
    for both OSS and ALSA. This should resolve Debian bug #567395
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567395).
  - Fix of Debian bug #567395 should also solve Debian bug #567397
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567397).
  - Changed library's API. There will be more API changes in 3.1, so
    consider current API to be unstable.
  - Changed volume change step from 5% to 1%.
  - Changed frequency change step from 100Hz to 20Hz.
  - The library no longer can produce sound on console buzzer and on
    sound card at the same time.
  - The library knows default names of OSS, ALSA and console buzzer
    devices. The names are used to open sound devices if no other
    names are provided explicitly as function arguments.
  - Introduced symbolic names of int values returned by most of
    library's function: CW_FAILURE / CW_SUCCESS.

  xcwcp:
  - Ported xcwcp to QT4. This should resolve Debian bug #604386
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=604386).
  - Added auto-detection of QT4 headers and QT4 moc by build files.
