version 3.3.0 / 2013.12.10

  unixcw:
  - Thomas Beierlein has reported that some combinations of
    '--enable-*'/'--disable-*' flags result in a code that fails to
    compile. He also provided a patch that fixes it. I've created a
    tool ('unixcw/tools/test_configure_flags.sh') that tests all
    combinations of configure flags, which also detected one more
    faulty configuration, in addition to the ones discovered by
    Thomas. Thanks Thomas!
  - FreeBSD patches: Diane Bruce provided a set of patches that fix
    compilation on FreeBSD (thank you!). Thanks to the patches the
    ./configure script now should support two new flags:
    --with-qt-cflags=<string>
    --with-qt-libraries=<path>
    The state of build system on FreeBSD may still not be perfect (I
    didn't test this myself on FreeBSD), but should now be better than
    it was.

  libcw:
  - new functions: adding new functions: cw_character_is_valid()
    (replaces cw_check_character()) and cw_string_is_valid() (replaces
    cw_check_string()). The old functions are still available, but
    have been marked as deprecated.
  - unit tests: improvements and expansion of unit test code testing
    public API.
  - unit tests: improvements and expansion of unit test code testing
    libcw's internal functions.
  - receiver code (responsible for receiving and recognizing Morse
    code keyed with iambic keyer or straight key) has been reviewed.
  - code handling incoming events for receiving iambic keyer has been
    improved. iambic keyer events sent from client code to libcw are
    recognized with better precision, which leads to better
    recognition of keyed characters. These changes don't change public
    API nor "external" behaviour of libcw - these are just
    improvements of existing functionality.
  - new function: cw_iambic_keyer_register_timer(): to be used by
    client code that wants to receive Morse code sent with mouse or
    keyboard keys emulating iambic key. The function is related to the
    change mentioned one point above.

    At this point the interface to iambic keying becomes a bit more
    complicated. It will take me some more time to figure it out
    completely. For now I've made some internal fixes and changes that
    improve one aspect of this functionality, and as a result I had to
    add this one function. Expect more changes in future.

    If you want to see an example of usage of the keyer API, see xcwcp
    source code.

  xcwcp:
  - xcwcp takes advantage of changes in how libcw handles iambic
    keying, and - with some additional modifications in xcwcp's code -
    gets improved handling of iambic keying.

  cwgen:
  - improving randomness of generated strings;
    until now if cwgen was called twice within the same second, it
    produced the same result (since the random function has been
    seeded with value returned by time()). Now the seed comes from
    gettimeofday() (the milliseconds part), so randomness has been
    improved a bit.

  cwutils:
  - unit tests: adding first unit test in cwutils/dictionary module.
  - bugfix: usage of __attribute__ ((deprecated("message"))) construct
    in cwutils/dictionary.h may have lead to compilation failure. This
    has been fixed by getting rid of "message" argument.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


version 3.2.0 / 2013.01.11

  unixcw:
  - Fixing faulty logic checking "--disable-feature" flags in configure.ac.
    Bug reported by Thomas Beierlein. Thanks Thomas!

  libcw:
  - Debugging facilities of the library are being rewritten and have been
    moved to new file: src/lib/libcw_debug.h. See the file for details of
    new interface. The interface may still change, and it isn't documented
    yet. List of CW_DEBUG_* flags has been modified. The old interface is
    being deprecated.
  - libcw now can generate tones with slopes shaped as sine function or as
    raised cosine function. The 'raised cosine' slope is now default.
  - Rewriting usage of "__attribute__ ((deprecated(msg)))" facility in libcw.h.
    A user has reported errors related to the attribute when compiling libcw
    with gcc 4.3.3.
  - Improving the method of queuing a space character. This helps me avoid
    problems in some corner cases (e.g. when a single space is queued, and
    tone queue's low watermark is set to 1).
  - Improving behaviour of cw_generator_new(). Under some circumstances it
    is less likely to fail to create new generator. There was also possibility
    of causing a client application to crash if the function failed, but
    this has been fixed.
  - Library version changed from 4.1.1 to 5.0.0.

  cwcp:
  - Fixing one small issue: in every new session with cwcp the application
    printed a space at the beginning of played text.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


version 3.1.1 / 2012.07.04

  libcw:
  - Fixing problem with interlocks in thread code. Library version
    changed from 4.0.0 to 4.1.1.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


version 3.1.0 / 2012.06.30

  unixcw:
  - Added support for PulseAudio.

    All applications from unixcw that produce audio output benefit from
    this. PulseAudio is the default audio backend on machines with installed
    and accessible PulseAudio server. If audio backend hasn't been specified
    by user, the applications try to access different sound backends in
    following order:
    PulseAudio -> OSS -> ALSA -> console buzzer.

    The usual restrictions for console buzzer output (root privileges
    required) still apply.

    Running application from unixcw package (cw, cwcp, xcwcp) with
    ALSA selected as sound backend while PulseAudio server is running
    will result in all kinds of different problems.  User is warned
    about such situation by the application.

  - Added 'Null' audio system as an optional audio backend. No sound is
    being played if this system is selected, libcw is spending its time only
    on generating tones of proper length and sending then in proper moments
    to a pseudo-device. Pass '-s n' option to unixcw application to use this
    'audio' backend.

  - Thanks to changes in libcw, unixcw doesn't 'require' ALSA or PulseAudio
    libraries, or PulseAudio server on target system, even if support for
    the two audio backends was compiled in. The two audio backends are now
    only recommended, thanks to linking to the libraries at run time.

  - Build system now uses libtool. 'libtool' script is in release
    archive, so there are no new compile-time requirements related to
    this (at least 'make distcheck' completes successfully with libtool
    package uninstalled).

  - It is possible to explicitly disable support for audio backends at
    compile time. Pass --disable-{console|oss|alsa|pulseaudio} to
    ./configure to do this.

  - It is possible to explicitly disable compilation of cwcp and xcwcp.
    Pass --disable-{cwcp|xcwcp} to ./configure to do this.

  - Build system now uses Makefile.am files as a basis to generate Makefile
    files.

  - Build system now supports and correctly builds "make distcheck" target.


  libcw:
  - Added support for PulseAudio.
    There are still some things to be improved in code implementing support
    for PulseAudio, but pretty solid basics are there.

  - Added support for Null pseudo-audio-system. Not sure if it will be useful,
    I just thought that someone would like to use libcw without generating
    any sound. Perhaps some simple platforms without audio devices, perhaps
    practicing sending/keying without playback. Who knows. It was easy to do,
    so I did it.

  - If you compare libcw.c files from this and previous release, you will
    notice lots of changes. This is because I've changed the algorithm that
    controls time periods when generating tones (generating sine wave).

    Until now the periods were measured with itimers. The tricky part was to
    keep two processed in sync: turning sine wave on and off, and sending
    the content of audio buffer with sine wave to audio backend. I'm calling
    it 'tricky' because it works fine only for small sizes of audio buffer,
    as was is in case of OSS (~128 samples). With larger buffer sizes forced
    by ALSA (~1k samples) the two processes de-synchronize. I had to come up
    with better design, and the side effect of the design is total rewrite
    of parts of libcw.c (for my own purposes I call the rewrite a 'butchering',
    but that is a different story).

    New design relies on blocking writes to audio systems, and their property
    of being able to play only X samples (Y milliseconds) at a time (with
    given sample rate).

  - Following functions are deprecated:
    cw_check_representation(),
    cw_lookup_representation(),
    cw_lookup_character().

    Use these instead:
    cw_representation_is_valid(),
    cw_representation_to_character(),
    cw_character_to_representation().

  - library's soname changed from 3.0.1 to 4.0.0

    Library's version becomes independent from version of unixcw.

  cwcp:
  - Fixing small bug in user interface: till now modifying practice time
    didn't work correctly, any attempts to do so resulted in resetting the
    time to zero. Now this is fixed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


version 3.0.2 / 2012.06.18

New version. You won't find it in git repo, but only in SourceForge download
area and on Debian webpage.
This is a special release with two goals related to Debian packaging:

  debian/:
  - fixing Debian's FTBFS bug #676752
  - removing debian/ from unixcw_X.Y.Z.orig.tar.gz. Contents of debian/ can be
    found in separately provided unixcw_X.Y.Z-W.debian.tar.gz

Thanks to Kamal Mostafa for patiently explaining to me some details of
Debian/Ubuntu packaging.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


version 3.0.1 / 2012.01.08

Thanks to Kamal Mostafa for providing patches that are the reason
for 3.0.1 release.
Content of upstream package unixcw-3.0.1 is approximately the same as of
Debian source package unixcw_3.0-5.

  debian/:
  - added proper "Section" field in control file;
  - fixed library dependencies in control file;
  - fixed "Replaces:"/"Conflicts:" fields in control file;
  - fixed Debian bug #653411: changes in *.preinst files to remove
    dangling symlinks left by old packaging (suggested by Bob Proulx);

  general:
  - fixed library dependencies in "configure" script;
  - fixed library dependencies provided by libcw.pc file;

  libcw:
  - proper detection of capabilities of liboss-salsa-dev
    (kfreebsd's libasound implementation); libcw now can be built
    properly on Debian/kFreeBSD;
  - fixing awk scripts producing man pages: the awk scripts now
    work with mawk too;

  cwcp:
  - fixed list of libraries in Makefile;


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


version 3.0 / 2011.12.13

Thanks to Simon Baldwin for creating this software in the
first place, and to Kamal Mostafa for helping me with packaging
unixcw 3.0 for Debian.

  unixcw:
  - Changed major version of unixcw package to '3'. Changes listed
    below probably justify this.
  - New main developer: Kamil Ignacak <acerion@wp.pl>
  - New website: http://unixcw.sourceforge.net
  - Scripts building Debian packages now build 'libcw3' package
    instead of 'unixcw' package, and 'libcw3-dev' Debian package instead
    of 'unixcw-dev' Debian package.

  libcw:
  - Renamed 'cwlib' part of unixcw package to 'libcw'.
  - Renamed library's header file from cwlib.h to libcw.h.
  - Changed library's soname from 0 to 3 (/usr/lib/libcw.so.3.0.0
    / libcw.so.3).
  - Added support for ALSA. OSS is still the default backend.
  - As a consequence, libasound2 is a new dependency. There is no
    possibility (yet) to disable or reconfigure this at build time.
    It is possible to select sound backend in applications that use
    libcw.
  - Added implicit dependency on pthread library (which is a part
    of libc library, so it should be available on target system by
    default). Main routine generating sine wave operates as a separate
    thread.
  - Added actual slopes to dot and dash sounds produced by the
    library. This should result in less of (or even none) audible
    pops. Unfortunately current implementation makes dots and dashes
    a tiny bit longer than they would be without the slopes. The
    difference is not significant, but I plan to re-implement it
    in the future to make this feature 100% correct.
    The slopes are linear.
  - Rewritten management of sound volume so that the library doesn't
    use OSS mixer. This should resolve Debian bug #567394
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567394).
    Code that controls volume level is common for OSS and ALSA.
  - Since libcw doesn't touch the mixer device anymore, then Debian
    bug #567392 should be resolved as well
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567392).
  - Added code that attempts to discover proper audio buffer size
    for both OSS and ALSA. This should resolve Debian bug #567395
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567395).
  - Fix of Debian bug #567395 should also solve Debian bug #567397
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567397).
  - Changed library's API. There will be more API changes in 3.1, so
    consider current API to be unstable.
  - Changed volume change step from 5% to 1%.
  - Changed frequency change step from 100Hz to 20Hz.
  - The library no longer can produce sound on console buzzer and on
    sound card at the same time.
  - The library knows default names of OSS, ALSA and console buzzer
    devices. The names are used to open sound devices if no other
    names are provided explicitly as function arguments.
  - Introduced symbolic names of int values returned by most of
    library's function: CW_FAILURE / CW_SUCCESS.

  xcwcp:
  - Ported xcwcp to QT4. This should resolve Debian bug #604386
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=604386).
  - Added auto-detection of QT4 headers and QT4 moc by build files.
