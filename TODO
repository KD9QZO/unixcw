TODO:



* Review unit tests for library.
   Now that I'm done with first round of review of
   main code of library, and that all unit tests are now in one place
   (in files implementing modules), and that the tests are run by
   singile driver, it's necessary to review, expand, improve and clean
   up unit tests code for libcw2.

* Why do we have two TODO files?
   There are two TODO files in main directory (TODO and TODO2). Unify
   them.

   Added on 2017-02-08.



Add to configure.ac a check for GNU make on build machine. unixcw's
   Makefiles may not work with non-GNU make on non Linux machines.



Add to configure.ac a check for pkg-config. It is necessary for
   configuring QT4 application (xcwcp).



Make qa_test_configure_flags.sh portable. Some shells (on FreeBSD)
   don't like the options[] table.



After finalizing split of libcw into modules, add configure flags for
   disabling modules (e.g. --disable-libcw-receiver,
   --disable-libcw-key).



Check if it's possible to use pkg-config to get ncurses compilation
   flags.
