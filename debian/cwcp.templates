_Description: Make cwcp setuid root?
 cwcp can produce sounds using console buzzer, but this feature
 is available only if cwcp is run by root user.
 You can achieve this by setting setuid bit here (not recommended)
 or by running cwcp with sudo (also not recommended). You can also
 use soundcard output instead of console buzzer output and
 eliminate this problem completely.
