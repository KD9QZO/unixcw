_Description: Make cwcp setuid root?
 The cwcp program only runs correctly as the root user. One way of doing
 this is to make the program setuid root. This is generally a bad idea as
 there are better ways, such as using the sudo program, to do this.
 However, you have the option here of making it setuid root if you like.
